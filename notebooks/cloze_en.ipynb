' i 've lost everything i owned , and that 's good news for you , because you do n't have to suffer and learn things the hard way . i 've done it for you . \" since its founding 14 years ago , curves has grown from one franchise to ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK every 10 franchised fitness facilities in the united states , making it the nation 's largest fitness chain . curves can be found in 44 countries , and it 's the largest fitness chain in canada , ireland , mexico , and new zealand . there are four million curves members worldwide . curves international , the franchiser , is privately held and family-owned , and employs just over 100 people at its headquarters in woodway , texas , a suburb of waco . the company says it now has systemwide revenue in excess of $1 billion . but curves , heavin insists , is about more than just money . \" i personally ca n't influence the lives of women . i ca n't get them to go to the gym , watch their weight , and take care of themselves , \" he tells the crowd at club camp . \" but me and 10,000 of you , and the 30,000 employees you 'll hire ?

with little to lose , heavin went for it . he was 20 years old and knew nothing about business , and the first year of running the gym was often terrifying . heavin struggled to find money to pay the gym 's electricity bill and often spent his nights on the floor of the facility 's daycare center . but in the process , he learned a few things about himself . first , he loved the fitness business . plus , he was a good salesperson , particularly when it came to dealing with women . he soon limited the gym 's membership to women only and named it women 's world of fitness . within a year , the club was doing well enough that the brothers decided to open another location . over the next six years , they opened another six more throughout south texas . \" by the time i was 26 , i had a $1 million financial statement , ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK , women 's world of fitness had 14 locations and 50,000 members . heavin got a pilot 's license and flew himself from location to location , keeping an eye on his growing empire . then things started to fall apart . in retrospect , the problems were simple . \" i let my overhead increase beyond the capacity of the market , \" heavin says . women 's world of fitness clubs were big , which meant high rents . they also offered swimming pools , tanning beds , and kids ' programs . such costly amenities require a large membership base , but aside from houston , the gyms were mostly in smaller towns . desperate to bring in more money , heavin decided to open his clubs to men . \" it was logical , but it destroyed my women 's business , \" he says . indeed , it did n't take long for female customers to grow uncomfortable with the meat-market aspect of a coed gym and drift away . as the business faltered , heavin 's managers grew restless . \" i spent ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK keep people disciplined and motivated , \" heavin says . in 1986 , about three years after opening its 14th location , women 's world of fitness was bankrupt . heavin lost his house , his airplane , and his cars , and was some $5 million dollars in debt . his wife divorced him . heavin lacked the money to pay alimony and in short order went from being a jet-setting entrepreneur to just another broke guy serving a three-month term in cameron county jail in brownsville . as often happens when people hit bottom , heavin turned to the bible for solace . he described the moment he became born again during a 2003 interview on pat robertson 's the 700 club . \" i finally got on my knees and said , ' god , i lived the first half of my life by my will , and it 's a mess . i 'm going to turn the rest of my life over to you . ' \" his religious beliefs gave him a new way to look at his mistakes -- not as failures ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK the lord 's larger plan for gary heavin . heavin began putting his life back together . he found work selling fitness equipment and consulting with gym owners and settled into life with a new wife . heavin met diane piller during the waning days of his gym business . diane , who had model-perfect features and the physique of a lifelong fitness fanatic , worked in newspaper advertising . women 's world of fitness was not only one of her accounts , it was also the place she went to get her aerobics fix . the relationship grew as the business collapsed , and in 1990 , the couple married , just before gary went to jail . \" it 's kind of a neat thing that we married then because he knew i really loved him , \" she says . \" he did n't have a lot of material things . \" the couple soon began plotting their return to the fitness business . their new gym would be different . overhead would be kept as low as possible . rather than investing in every ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK simple fitness circuit that would be quick and easy for members to complete . instead of operating as dose to 24-7 as possible , a common practice in the industry , the gym would close early . showers , de rigueur at most gyms , were also deemed expendable . and most important of all : it would be women only . diane came up with the name -- curves -- and sketched out a cursive logo on a piece of paper . if everything worked out , the heavins figured they 'd be able to earn about $100,000 a year . with $10,000 they 'd managed to scrape together , they opened the first curves in 1992 in harlingen , texas , where they lived , with diane as manager . it was immediately clear that the simple formula would work . the couple had estimated it would take 90 days to sell 100 memberships -- the amount they 'd need to break even . diane sold that amount in the first week alone . in 1994 , they opened a second club in mcallen , and it ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK from his jailhouse religious awakening , the newfound success made perfect sense . \" it 's kind of like moses in the bible , \" he says . \" i spent 10 years in egypt , which was the old health club business . and then i spent 10 years in the desert ; i was a consultant , i was in the equipment business , i traveled around . and then at age 40 , it all just came together . everything we tried , worked . we entered into the promised land . \" by 1995 , the heavins had far exceeded their wildest dreams . \" we had two curves , a brand-new baby , and we were earning a quarter of a million a year , \" says gary . \" we were going to live happily ever after . \" then he had an epiphany . heavin was giving a talk on weight management to a group of women when he realized heft been scanning the crowd for the face of his mother , who had died when he was 13 . \" ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK , \" he says . \" my two little brothers and i found her . it was a real traumatic experience . \" doris joy heavin had suffered from obesity , high blood pressure , and depression , all of which were treated with medication rather than the recommendation that she get more exercise . heavin grew furious when he thought about it . perhaps this explained why he wanted to be a doctor , why he enjoyed the fitness business so much . \" i had the epiphany that what my life had been about was healing women because of my mother , \" he says . \" and that was what my destiny was going to be . \" heavin would heal women before they got sick . curves would be the vehicle , and he needed to spread it as far and wide as possible . the question was how to do it . he did n't want to expand by opening more gyms and trusting strangers to manage them ; managers , he felt , had served him poorly at women 's world of fitness ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK he told his wife . diane , who had come to enjoy her new lifestyle , thought the move was way too risky . \" i did n't feel like eating beans again , \" she says . gary understood her fears , but pressed his case . franchising , he said , made perfect business sense . \" i believe you can teach a manager to care enough to make a pretty good cup of coffee , \" heavin says . \" but it 's hard to make a manager care enough to run a fitness club . only an owner will care enough to do the job . \" there were spiritual concerns , as well . \" we 've been given this gift and if we do n't use it , it will be taken away , \" he told diane . he reminded her that they were required to use the gifts they had been given and to bless others as they 'd been blessed . after sleeping on it , diane came around . \" okay , \" she asked , \" how ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK a thing about franchising . heavin turned to an acquaintance , gary findley , for advice . findley was vice president of franchise sales at the dwyer group , a well-established franchiser of residential services such as mr. rooter , glass doctor , and others , and was a fount of information . heavin ran a $250 ad in the paris news in paris , texas , and quickly sold his first franchise . after he sold his third franchise , heavin called findley . \" i 've got a little money coming in now , \" he said , \" and i can pay you to come onboard . \" findley became curves ' first employee and was soon named president . the early days of curves were far from glamorous . using heavin 's pickup truck and an open-bed trailer , the two garys would bring equipment to franchisees . they 'd scrape bugs off the machines before delivering them , and always carried white spray paint to cover up the dings and scratches that cropped up during transport . diane created marketing and training materials . ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK bottles with the company 's logo . when the company decided to create a glossy magazine for members , heavin named it diane . from the outset , heavin was looking for a different kind of franchisee -- someone who was looking less for a business opportunity than for a mission . the typical franchiser , he says , \" looks for people . who want to run a business and tries to teach them passion . we 're looking for people with passion , and we 'll teach them how to run a business . \" so rather than plastering the franchise trades with ads like most franchisers , curves has found nearly all of its franchisees through word of mouth -- as often as not from its own membership base . many share heavin 's christian faith . franchisees are not required to have any background in entrepreneurship or experience in the fitness industry , but heavin says that the company is selective : applicants must display a willingness to work hard and , more important , have a passion to serve . amy and randy ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK . amy joined a curves gym and now the couple , who are married , own one in batesville , arkansas . \" we like gary 's philosophy , \" says randy , \" and we like the idea that it 's for women 's health . \" adds amy : \" with curves , you 're one-on-one with people . at subway , you do have your regular people that come in and out , but you 're not affecting their health , and that 's really motivating to me , to be able to help other ladies like that . \" the simses also like the way curves handles financial matters . in most franchising arrangements , franchisees pay the franchiser a franchise fee at the outset ( at curves , the current fee is $39,900 ;

such products currently are a $25 million-a-year business . ( that business , a separate company called ideas in ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK 's more , the royalty cap made it a cinch to attract new franchisees . \" the more money our franchisees would make , the happier they were , and they 'd shout about it , \" heavin says . and shout they did . in 1996 , there were 44 curves gyms . in 1997 , there were 247 . the heavins decided to move their headquarters from their home to a proper office . they rented two offices and soon added a third . the next year , the number of curves franchises doubled again , to 537 , and the heavins moved curves headquarters from harlingen to waco , to a low-slung building across the street from a waste-treatment facility . they had five employees and never thought they 'd outgrow that building . in 2000 , there were more than 1,200 franchises . in 2001 , curves doubled in size again . by 2004 , the company had more than 8,000 franchises , and curves moved again , to its current capacious headquarters : a rustic , ranchlike building in woodway , with working fireplaces ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK cowboys taking aim at indians . heavin credits curves ' rapid growth to the low-overhead business model , which allows the company to open profitably in towns too small for other gyms . \" we created an efficient business model that could go where no one else could , \" he says . indeed , the average curves club today has only 400 members -- which , according to a formula the company has developed , is what a town with a population of about 10,000 can sustain . targeting smaller towns and cities had several strategic advantages . for one thing , it made it easier to attract members , because curves often was the only fitness option in town . it also made it easier to attract new franchisees : the territories were small enough that an enthusiastic curves member could open a gym one or two towns over without poaching business . the low-overhead model also meant that the buy-in for a franchisee was n't steep -- a little under $20,000 in those days , including the equipment . and franchising in out-of-the-way places gave ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK largely hidden from rivals , which allowed the company to sell hundreds of franchises without arousing competition . marketing also proved easy . curves promised a fast-yet-effective workout , along with a sense of community with like-minded women . this promise was particularly attractive during the mid- to late 1990s . aging boomers were being urged by their doctors to spend more time at the gym . but few women are able to put this advice into practice : some 66 percent of women say they never get 10 minutes or more of any kind of vigorous physical activity a week , according to a 2004 report by the centers for disease control and prevention . what 's more , heavin 's frank talk about religiously inspired values could not have been timed better . not only were megachurches on the rise , but the family-friendly aspect of curves ownership -- hours that allow you to be home to have dinner with your family -- also had a strong appeal and stood in stark contrast with the around-the-clock service required by other franchisers . to be sure , ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK , for example , news broke that the heavins had given generously to an anti-abortion group , sparking a moral dilemma for many pro-choice curves members . the issue even surfaced in the new york times magazine 's column the ethicist . the column 's author , randy cohen , suggested that pro-choice curves members who value their reproductive rights more than their figures should relinquish their memberships . very few members actually left , however , and curves continued its rapid growth . the numbers are indisputable . \" it took mcdonald 's 25 years to reach 6,000 locations . it took subway 26 years , \" says heavin . \" and it took us eight . \" back at club camp , heavin wraps up his remarks and opens the floor to questions from the franchisees . how can i inspire teamwork among my employees , one wants to know . will curves authorize a price increase anytime soon , asks another . then heavin gets this question from a franchisee in colorado : \" hi , gary . i know what you do for women is ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK any testing in consumer markets ? i 've been asked this question by my own members . \" \" here 's the answer so you can tell your members , \" heavin replies . \" when hell freezes over . \" raising his voice to be heard over the applause and cheers , he explains himself . \" compared with women , men do n't seem to be that loyal . for five bucks off the dues , he 's going to go down the street . also , in a gym environment , men do n't bring their friends . when you 're sitting at a table with several people , does bob get up and say , ' come on , jim and john , let 's go the bathroom together ? ' men do n't work that way . \" after the laughter dies down , heavin turns somber . \" the men 's fitness business is a terrible place to go -- and i 've been there , by the way . will the curves equipment and physiology work for men ? sure . would ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK constantly to do this . maybe someone else will figure out a smart way to do it . but we 're going to take care of the women ? he gets another robust round of applause . some ceos might at least take a moment to consider a brand extension idea offered repeatedly by franchisees and customers . but not heavin . \" when it comes to women 's fitness , just by sheer numbers , i 'm the world 's undisputed expert . i 'm the visionary , \" he says . \" we certainly get a lot of good ideas from members and franchisees . but the big ideas , they come primarily from me . \" he points to this fact : of the nearly 10,000 curves locations that have opened , only 300 have closed . of those , 200 have reopened successfully . the question , of course , is whether heavin 's faith in his own judgment , and the credence he puts in lessons learned from past mistakes , will continue to suffice as curves makes the transition from a fast-growing ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK not everybody thinks so . gary findley , for example , began suggesting to heavin that with growth slowing -- the chain now opens about 1,000 new franchises a year -- the company needed to begin opening complementary businesses under the curves umbrella . \" in order for curves to maintain its spot ahead of the competition , it needs to provide some additional income opportunities for franchisees , \" he says . \" at some point , they 're going to reach their maximum income potential . \" heavin , on the other hand , was adamant about keeping the focus squarely on 30-minute circuit training for women . indeed , new franchisees are warned that if they deviate at all -- by adding , say , treadmills or tanning beds to their clubs -- they 'll be in violation of their franchise agreements and run the risk of losing their businesses . in 2004 , at the age of 43 , findley retired . his plan was to devote his time to a ministry for men , centered around hunting . but the retirement did n't last ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK who noticed that a day spa next to her club was doing brisk business with her members . intrigued , he decided to invest in a membership-based day spa called facelogic , which has sold 29 locations in less than a year . it 's hard not to notice that this easily could have happened under the curves umbrella . findley remains close with heavin and his sister-in-law still holds an executive position at curves . but he thinks that heavin 's focus on what 's worked for curves in the past may impede the chain 's future growth . heavin sees little reason to change course . of the 41 franchise systems in the adult fitness sector , curves boasts a 40 percent market share . but 10 newcomers have emerged in the past two years -- a large number of newcomers , says darrell johnson , president of frandata , a franchise research consultancy in arlington , virginia . none of these newbies are likely to knock curves off its perch , says johnson . but collectively , they threaten to whittle away at the leader 's ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK these new franchisers are slicing the market into ever smaller segments , appealing to upscale women , or women over 50 , or younger women . \" the fitness segment has moved from a one-size-fits-all model to a very specialized model , \" johnson says . consider cuts , a 30-minute fitness franchise for men that recently launched cuts women . many cuts women customers are former curves members who are sold on the idea of a 30-minute workout but are bored with curves ' routine and want something more intense , says john gennaro , founder of the franchise , which is based in clark , new jersey . with 90 locations and 15,000 members , cuts is puny compared with curves . but that does n't bother gennaro . he 's happy to let curves educate women about 30-minute fitness -- and even happier to provide an alternative when they grow restless . maturity has created other problems , as well . there are very few new territories available in the united states , so most new domestic franchisees are those who have purchased an existing ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK . the average new club today costs about $40,000 ; a resale , $120,000 , and many new franchisees wind up borrowing heavily . curves recently created a department dedicated to the specific issues that crop up during the resale experience , but there are other operational issues to confront . the company has a ways to go before it truly can be considered the mcdonald 's of fitness , admits mike raymond , the company 's former director of marketing , who became president after findley stepped down . \" mcdonald 's has a well-defined management structure , well-defined methods of operation in different countries , with levels of autonomy worked out , and information technology systems , \" he says . \" we 're working toward that now . \" if any of this concerns heavin , you 'd be hard-pressed to notice . as confident as ever , he splits his time between his office and the new 6,000-square-foot home he and diane just built . it 's on a 1,000-acre , tree-studded ranch in crawford , not far from president bush 's spread . rustically ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK \" it has two kitchens and plenty of plush , oversize furniture . out of sight from the main house are the smaller homes of many in the heavins ' extended family . gary 's brother paul lives in one . three others are occupied by diane 's parents ; her sister and niece ; and her brother and his family . like many large-scale compounds in the area , the ranch has a name : almost heaven . the couple belong to two nearby churches , highland baptist church in waco and mound cowboy church in gatesville , and are active in a number of philanthropic efforts . heavin plans to expand curves in two ways . the first is through a weight-management plan , the curves 6 week solution , which is designed to appeal to women who prefer dieting to exercise . the six-week course costs $69 and is taught by franchisees . the idea is to expose the dieters to the curves workout during their weekly classes , which will be held right in the club itself . heavin also is developing partnerships with health ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK community in the united states . as a result , heavin says , the company is an ideal partner for insurers , which have begun boosting their wellness programs , including offering policyholders rebates if they regularly attend a gym . heavin estimates that eight million americans are eligible to have some or all of their curves memberships paid for by their health insurance . if even a fraction of those millions sign up , it could represent an enormous opportunity . and if it does n't ? sitting in his office with his cowboy boots up on his desk , heavin says this : \" for a lot of people in my position , the position defines who they are . for me , i was as happy flat broke as i am flying my learjet . i do n't define myself by my quarterly profits . i define myself as a child of god that 's been created in his image for eternity . if that becomes your defining image , there 's extraordinary power in it . \" he pauses for a minute . \" i ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ##UNK ;
